Fish Feeder and Aquarium Monitoring System

This Qt-based Raspberry Pi 4 project automates fish feeding and monitors your aquarium. It uses an MG90 servo for feeding, an HC-SR04 sensor for water level, and a DS18B20 sensor for water temperature.
Features:

    Manual Feeding: Dispenses fish food at your command via the GUI.
    Water Level Monitoring: Measures water level in your aquarium.
    Temperature Tracking: Monitors water temperature.
    User-Friendly GUI: Easily configure and monitor the system.
    Customizable Settings: Adjust temperature alerts and other parameters.

Hardware:

    Raspberry Pi 4
    MG90 Servo Motor
    HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
    DS18B20 Temperature Sensor
    Aquarium
    Power Supply
    Jumper Wires

How It Works:

This system, built on a Raspberry Pi, uses sensors to monitor your aquarium's water level and temperature. It allows manual fish feeding via the Qt-based GUI and provides real-time monitoring of water conditions.
